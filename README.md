# üßëüèº‚Äçüíª Debugging, Testing and Watching

### üêõ Debugging

There is a `Debug Extension` launch configuration in the `./.vscode/launch.json` file. This configuration will launch a new instance of Visual Studio Code with the extension loaded.

### üß™ Testing

There is a sample `./src/test/extension.test.ts` file that contains a simple test. You can add tests to this file or create new test files in the `./src/test/` directory with a `.test.ts` extension. You can include addition test file naming conventions by modifying the `files` property in the `./vscode-test.mjs` file.

There is three ways to run the tests:

1. The Testing Side Bar. \*
2. Use the `Run All Tests` command in the Command Palette. \*
3. The `Run Tests` launch configuration in the `./.vscode/launch.json` file.

\*: The first two ways to run tests will download a copy of Visual Studio Code (saved to `./.vscode-test/` directory) and runs the tests in that instance.

This uses `vscode-test` and `test-cli`. See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test-cli and https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension for more information.

### üëÄ Watching

There is a task in the `./.vscode/tasks.json` file that will run automatically when the project is opened. This runs the package's `watch` script which runs `tsc -watch`. Its output is viewable in the Terminal panel.

# üõ†Ô∏è Included Command-Line Tools

A couple of tools are included in this repository to help with development, testing and publishing.

| Tool        | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./npmx.sh` | Helper for NPM tasks                                     |
| `./vscx.sh` | Helper for creating, testing and releasing `.vsix` files |

Use the `-h` switch to view help information for each tool.

### npmx.sh

-   Cleans, installs and updates dependencies.
-   Compiles package for publishing ‚Äî omits dev dependencies; uses publish TypeScript configuration.
-   Used by `./package.json` scripts.

### vscx.sh

-   Creates `.vsix` files for local testing and release.
-   Versions `.vsix` files using the `./package.json` version.
-   Installs and uninstalls `.vsix` files for local testing.
-   Uses global `vsce` NPM tool to create `.vsix` files.
-   Note: `vsce` calls `./package.json` `vscode:prepublish` script during its process which in turn calls `./npmx.sh`.

# üìù Before Publishing

_Brand_ your extension.

1. Add an icon in `./icon/` directory and modify the `./package.json` file to match the icon's path. An icon size of 512x512 seems to render well.
2. Modify this `./README.md` file to match your extension. This is what is displayed on the extension's Visual Studio Marketplace page.
3. Modify the `./CHANGELOG.md` file to match your extension. This is what is displayed on the extension's Visual Studio Marketplace page.
4. Install the extension locally and try to break it. See below `./vscx.sh pub-install` command for more information.

# üöÄ Publishing

There are two ways to package your extension for the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Using VS Code Command

Use the `Package Visual Studio Code Extension...` command to create a `.vsix` file for distribution. This will create a `.vsix` file in the `./releases/` directory (by default) that can be uploaded to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Using Command-Line Tool

You can use `./vscx.sh` (included in this repository; not to be confused with `vsce`) to create a `.vsix` file for distribution. Unless the `-d:` option is used, it will output a `.vsix` file in a `./releases/` directory that can be uploaded to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

`./vscx.sh` uses `./npmx.sh` to install dependencies and compile the extension for release. `./npmx.sh` will omit dev dependencies and use a publish TypeScript configuration to compile the extension.

#### Example commands

| Command                 | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./vscx.sh publish`     | Create `.vsix` file for release.                                                                   |
| `./vscx.sh pub-install` | Create `.vsix` file for release and install it. Use this to test your extension locally installed. |
| `./vscx.sh -h`          | View help information.                                                                             |

A command you'll probably end up using a lot is `./vscx.sh -oxy pi` which will:

1. Confirm yes to run.
2. Create a `.vsix` file for release, overwriting existing `.vsix` file of the same version (if exists).
3. Uninstalling extension (if installed).
4. Install the extension using the new `.vsix` file.

Note: If you install a `.vsix` file locally for testing, you'll want to uninstall it after to later install the new version from the Visual Studio Code Extensions Side Bar once published to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Publishing `.vsix` file to the Visual Studio Marketplace

Log into to the Visual Studio Marketplace and go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage to upload the `.vsix` file.

See https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#publishing-extensions and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace for more information.
